# In this project I built a blog website

## I used ejs, node, express, and mongoDB

This dynamic website is stores it's blog content on a MongoDB database. Some login features are currently enabled. User account creation and features are coming soon.

This project is meant as a fun blog concept for me to develope further in the future.
